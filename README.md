## Introduction
I am a strategic engineering leader covering ML Ops & Governance. I work at Starling Bank in London. I design and build systems and teams to solve business problems with data and ML.

## Key Achievements
* Created an 'accessible ML' framework at Starling, increasing the amount of ML models produced
by making ML workflow tooling usable by a broader community (data analysts as well as data
scientists)
* Shipped a real-time data platform and rebuilt the data engineering team at Starling; multiplying
the number of people who could accomplish work in the data warehouse by 10x. Business
feedback, "whenever I want data, itâ€™s there."
* Launched an internal, algorithmic competitive intelligence tool for a UK national supermarket,
driving price competitiveness and product range decisions.
